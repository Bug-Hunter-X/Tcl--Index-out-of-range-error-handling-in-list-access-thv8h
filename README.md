This repository contains a Tcl script demonstrating an uncommon error related to index out of bounds handling when accessing elements of a list.  The `get_element` procedure is designed to retrieve an element from a list given its index. However, it only checks for negative indices being out of bounds, causing an error when a positive index exceeds the list's bounds. The solution demonstrates a more robust implementation.
